## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a patient experiencing a heart attack with a high degree of accuracy. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, my model has achieved a final mean accuracy of 87%.

## Goal

The primary goal of this study is to contribute to the early detection and prediction of heart attacks. By analyzing various patient features and employing sophisticated algorithms, we aim to provide valuable insights that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals.

## Data

Our predictive model is built upon a comprehensive dataset that includes diverse patient information. Features such as age, gender, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors are considered to create a robust and reliable prediction model.

## Requirements
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Xgboost

### Machine Learning Algorithms

I have employed various machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn patterns from the provided data. The predictive model goes through a rigorous training process to ensure its effectiveness in predicting heart attacks accurately.
The various machine learning algorithms are:
1) Linear Regression
2) Gaussian Naive Bayes
3) Bernoulli Naive Bayes
4) Support Vector Machine
5) Random Forest
6) K Nearest Neighbours
7) X Gradient Boosting
